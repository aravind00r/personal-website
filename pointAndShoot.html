                  <h3>General</h3>
                  <p>This is a dope project.</p>
                  <h3>General Pt.2</h3>
                  <p>To expand on my previous &ltp&gt’s words, I made this project as a proof of concept of using a phone’s built-in gyroscope as a user input for a mobile fps game. I tried to play Fortnite mobile and PUBG mobile, but both games felt far lacking in comparison to their PC and console counterparts. So, I experimented to develop a model mobile fps game featuring gyroscopic input to aim weapons in the game. The slider on the bottom is a ease of acess feautre to make it so you do not have to acctually turn 360° to turn around in the game.</p>
                  <h3>Process</h3>
                  <p>In order to take the gyroscope input and produce accurate results in the virtual environment, I had to do some research on the Unity 3D gyroscope package and learned that it returned me quaternions rather than the standard Euler angles I was familiar dealing with in previous projects. After doing some mathematical research on converting between the two and getting a grasp on what quaternions actually represent in real 3D space I was able to produce the effects I desired in rotating the player’s camera in the 3D environment in a 1:1 ration with the physical rotation of the human user’s phone.</p>
                  <h3>Bells and Whistles</h3>
                  <p>I also spent a large part of my summer expanding beyond just the base gyroscope to make it a somewhat functioning game. While not as teaching as the creative process and research required to add a new input scheme that is not prevalent at all, in my opinion, in the mobile game community, the game mechanics taught me how to really pursue a long project with the goal of quality. Before this project most games I developed were explicitly just proofs of concepts and features, but I really endeavored to create a quality game with this project. But the timeline became too demanding for me as I started college and had to leave it behind. Along with the fact that when it comes to ideas such as level and environment design, I lack the experience in making an exciting game environment, resulting in a hodgepodge game map with various little features and bugs.</p>
                  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                  <p>I made several iterations after the one presented in the demo video, but due to the tragic loss of my cell phone that held the APK and the loss of my beloved clunky laptop that held the unity project, this was the last recoverable version of the project. I learned that solo development of a full project where you lack a lot of the artistic needs for a project like this is a disastrous plan. The result was spiraling towards a very well coded project with exciting ideas and features behind the scenes and a junkyard looking game map with models out of completely un-related themes. The project lacked a lot of the flow and general thought outside of the code that are present in good production mobile games.</p>
                  <h3>Future</h3>
                  <p>It would make me happy if I could take this idea and get together with like-minded developer to develop a real mobile fps game using this mechanic. I think this idea could be quite literally game changing and remains un-explored in the community of similar games.</p>
